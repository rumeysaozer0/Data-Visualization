                         Before the Project-First Explanations
Step A-Project Problem Definition:
Corona virus, which emerged in China in 2019, spread to almost all countries around the world. The virus, which causes a new world order, has many negative effects. One of these effects is the psychosocial effect.
This epidemic causes psychological and behavioral problems as well as its biological effects. It is not only the virus that is transmitted, but also the extreme phobic reactions caused by social trauma, mental problems such as depression, panic, paranoia, and destructive behaviors such as selfishness, impulsivity, aggression and stigmatization. In extraordinary situations, people temporarily lose their moral values such as courtesy, common sense, empathy, and solidarity and turn into a selfish creature who only thinks of themselves. Therefore, the psychology created by epidemics spreads much faster than the virus and even affects people who are not at risk of encountering the virus. In a sense, the viral pandemic brings along a pandemic psychology.For this reason, different solutions are being sought to overcome this situation with minimal damage.
